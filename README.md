# hangupsbot_plugins
These are my assorted plugins for Hangupsbot.  A few are Ingress related, most aren't.

- [**Blipshift**](blipshift.py) : Scrapes the t-shirt of the day on http://www.blipshift.com
- [**Clash**](clash.py) : Searches the ClashOfClans API for clan stats.  This requires the coc-client for [Python 2](https://github.com/miguelcb84/coc-client) or [Python3](https://github.com/redleader36/coc-client)
- [**Craigslist**](craigslist.py) : This fetches the image and title of a Craigslist posting when someone submits a Craigslist URL in a Hangout.
-  [**One Up**](game_oneup.py) : This is a Ingress-related game where players must create larger and larger fields and outdo each other's MU counts.  Rounds last one week and a scoreboard is kept in memory.
- [**Blipshift**](blipshift.py) : Scrapes the free ebook of the day at https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning
